The game of Mastermind coded in Python, using the pygame library.

The goal of the game is to guess the correct sequence of colors, that were randomly generated, within ten guesses. By clicking on the circles on the guess line you are on, you can change the colors of your guess. Pressing the green square commits your guess, where you'll recieve feedback about your guess, and move onto the next guess line if your guess wasn't completely correct.

On the right side of each guess line is a feedback square. After you commit a guess, 4 possible circles will appear in these squares. White circles indicate a right color has been guessed, but is in the wrong position, and a black circle indicates a right color has been used and is in the right position. A lack of a circle means a wrong color has been used.

If you can't guess the right sequence within 10 tries, you lose, but if you can, you may be a....... "MasterMind" lol
